 * Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.
 * <p>
 * This method implements the bottom-up DP approach, which:
 * 1. Starts from the base cases (fib(0) and fib(1))
 * 2. Builds up the solution iteratively
 * 3. Stores intermediate results in an array to avoid redundant calculations
 * <p>
 * Bottom-up vs Top-down:
 * - Bottom-up: Iterative, builds solution from smaller sub-problems to larger ones
 * - Top-down: Recursive, starts from the final problem and breaks it down, often using memoization
 * <p>
 *
 * @param n The position in the Fibonacci sequence to calculate.
 *          Must be a non-negative integer.
 * @return The nth Fibonacci number.
 *         Returns n itself if n is 0 or 1.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n) - We iterate from 2 to n once
 * Space complexity: O(n) - We use an array of size n+1 to store all Fibonacci numbers up to n

    Time Complexity Explanation:
    - The time complexity is O(2^n) because for each n, we make two recursive calls.
    - This creates a binary tree of recursive calls, where the number of calls doubles at each level.
    - The height of this tree is n, so we have approximately 2^n nodes (function calls) in total.

    Space Complexity Explanation:
    - The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursive call stack.
    - In the worst case, when we reach the deepest level of recursion, there will be n function calls on the stack.
    - Each call uses a constant amount of memory, so the total space used is proportional to n.
